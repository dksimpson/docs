# Tutorial: Use a Windows Communication Foundation client

This tutorial describes the last of five tasks required to create a basic Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) application. For an overview of the tutorials, see [Tutorial: Get started with Windows Communication Foundation applications](getting-started-tutorial.md).

Once you've created and configured a Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) proxy, you can create a client instance and compile the client application. You then use it to communicate with the WCF service. 

In this tutorial, you learn how to:
> [!div class="checklist"]
> - Instantiate the WCF client.
> - Call the service operations from the generated proxy.
> - Close the client after the operation call is completed.
> - Start the WCF service and run the WCF client.

## Use a Windows Communication Foundation client

Open the *Program.cs* (or *Module1.vb*) file from the **GettingStartedClient** project and replace the existing code with the following code:

```csharp
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Text;
using GettingStartedClient.ServiceReference1;

namespace GettingStartedClient
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //Step 1: Create an instance of the WCF proxy.
            CalculatorClient client = new CalculatorClient();

            // Step 2: Call the service operations.
            // Call the Add service operation.
            double value1 = 100.00D;
            double value2 = 15.99D;
            double result = client.Add(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Subtract service operation.
            value1 = 145.00D;
            value2 = 76.54D;
            result = client.Subtract(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Multiply service operation.
            value1 = 9.00D;
            value2 = 81.25D;
            result = client.Multiply(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Call the Divide service operation.
            value1 = 22.00D;
            value2 = 7.00D;
            result = client.Divide(value1, value2);
            Console.WriteLine("Divide({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result);

            // Step 3: Close the client to gracefully close the connection and clean up resources.
            client.Close();

            Console.WriteLine("\nPress <Enter> to terminate client.\n");
        }
    }
}
```

```vb
Imports System
Imports System.Collections.Generic
Imports System.Text
Imports System.ServiceModel
Imports GettingStartedClient.ServiceReference1

Module Module1

    Sub Main()
        ' Step 1: Create an instance of the WCF proxy.
        Dim Client As New CalculatorClient()

        ' Step 2: Call the service operations.
        ' Call the Add service operation.
        Dim value1 As Double = 100D
        Dim value2 As Double = 15.99D
        Dim result As Double = Client.Add(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Add({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        ' Call the Subtract service operation.
        value1 = 145D
        value2 = 76.54D
        result = Client.Subtract(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Subtract({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        ' Call the Multiply service operation.
        value1 = 9D
        value2 = 81.25D
        result = Client.Multiply(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Multiply({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        ' Call the Divide service operation.
        value1 = 22D
        value2 = 7D
        result = Client.Divide(value1, value2)
        Console.WriteLine("Divide({0},{1}) = {2}", value1, value2, result)

        ' Step 3: Close the client to gracefully close the connection and clean up resources.
        Client.Close()

        Console.WriteLine()
        Console.WriteLine("Press <Enter> to terminate client.")
        Console.ReadLine()

    End Sub

End Module
```

Notice the `using` (for Visual C#) or `Imports` (for Visual Basic) statement that imports `GettingStartedClient.ServiceReference1`. This statement imports the code that Visual Studio generated with the **Add Service Reference** function. The code instantiates the WCF proxy and calls each of the service operations that the calculator service exposes. It then closes the proxy and ends the program.

To test the application, first run *GettingStartedHost.exe* to start the service, and then run *GettingStartedClient.exe*.

*GettingStartedHost.exe* produces the following output:

```text
The service is ready.
Press <ENTER> to terminate service.

Received Add(100,15.99)
Return: 115.99
Received Subtract(145,76.54)
Return: 68.46
Received Multiply(9,81.25)
Return: 731.25
Received Divide(22,7)
Return: 3.14285714285714
```

*GettingStartedClient.exe* produces the following output:

```text
Add(100,15.99) = 115.99
Subtract(145,76.54) = 68.46
Multiply(9,81.25) = 731.25
Divide(22,7) = 3.14285714285714

Press <ENTER> to terminate client.
```
